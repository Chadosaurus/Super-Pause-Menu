V2.3.1

-Fixed an issue if someone had an incorrectly labelled .cbr file as a cbz, and vice versa, it will now try opening up the manuals as the opposite file type if there are issues the first time.

-Added logic so the menu will display the word "Error!" within the gui breifly if the cbr or cbz file has issues opening (ie, no contents in the file).

-Changed how the menu retrieves the pages when page "turned" for better performance.

V2.3.0 

    -Added CBR and CBZ support for manuals

    -Updated settings program, now has "alternative manual root folder" selection. Will be used for launchbox and attract-mode for CBZ, CBR manuals. Can be used in conjunction with launchbox's pdfs.

    -Updated launchbox dll plugin from .net core 3.1 to 6. Can now push game filepath to the pause menu

    -Updated default emulator profile for mame for the default hotkeys for v 0.273. Ensure your command line parameters for mame  are "-keyboardprovider dinput" inside of Launchbox. For attract-mode (and +) Command arguments in would be [name] -keyboardprovider dinput

    -Added a folder in \Super pause menu\Emulators for older emulator hotkey configs. Called "Older and alt emulator configs"

    -Changed the pause/unpause button in mame to F5 to match the new mame default keys.

    -If a game were to be closed externally while the pause menu screen was up, there is potential for the game to be muted on next launch. I added some logic to unmute on the next launch if that were the case.

    -Removed manual folder path option in the attract mode plugin menu, can change the setting in the settings.exe


V2.2.1 - Fixed a bug where the reset option shows on the menu even when it's disabled in the settings. Fixed some errors on the manual file.
