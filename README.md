Super Pause Menu is a Windows Pause menu plugin/executable for Launchbox/BigBox Attract-Mode and Attract-Mode +.

To install:

Download the Super Pause Menu Vxx.zip file. Right click the file in your downloads folder, go to properties -> Check the Unblock square and click apply, then close the dialog.

Right click the file again and choose: Extract All.. when the browse menu pops up choose your root launchbox, Attract-Mode, or Attract-Mode+ directory and click extract. A dialog will pop up asking you you to merge the plugins folder, choose "Yes".
You will now have a new folder located the directory of your chosen front end emulator labeled “Super pause menu”. 
Two new files labeled Super Pause Menu.nut and Super Pause Menu.dll will be placed in your plugins folder.  

If using launchbox/bigbox, the Super Pause Menu.nut file can be deleted, 
if using attract-mode or attract-mode + the Super Pause Menu.dll file can be deleted 
from the plugins folder.
Installation is complete.
For first time use, especially if you're using attract-mode or attract-mode +, please see the Super Pause Menu Manual.pdf located in the "Super Pause Menu" folder located in the root directory of your front end emulator for Set-up instructions.

NOTE: There is a few errors I noticed in the manual. Specifically step 6 of the attract-mode manual:

6. The last option is “Manual folder location” if left at Default it will choose the 
location of “attract-mode\Super pause menu\Manuals\Platform Name\”. The pause 
menu will look for a file named the same as your rom filename but with an image 
extension.

The pause menu look for a .pdf file to use as a manual file, NOT an image file. I will add this change to the manual in the next version.
